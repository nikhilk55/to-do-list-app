#to-do-app
This application is built using React js with Typescript.
Used Ant design for buliding UI Components, CSS and Bootstrap for styling and layouts.
Created authentication system which allows users to login with their googlr accounts. User need to signup before login.
Created a storage using firebase to store each individuals to-do separately.
Users are able to perform all the CRUD operations.

Removed all the node modules from the folder since it's over 100 MB and I cannot send it through forms.
